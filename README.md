**Why?**

The open bank project has been created to replicate banking facilities on the blockchain. The idea is to provide smart contracts with banking support to facilitate innovation
in fund management surrounding dApps. The initial idea is to provide pluggable functionality that a wallet hard or soft does not typically provide. The difference between this 
type of bank and a regular bank is that this bank is non-custodial. I.e. Once you've bought your instance of the Open Bank contract it's yours and yours alone. If you want support
for your contract you have to select a provider, if you want an overdraft style facility you have to find your own provider, if you want your bank to treat any money at rest in 
a particular way e.g. invest in a DeFi Liquidity Pool you have to link that up yourself. The idea is to make all of these features (and more) easy and intuitive to use, so new innovative 
decentralized financial services can be plugged into your account. 

How is this different from your hardware wallet? Simple, you don't need to upgrade your bank because for the most part the contract will be supported within the parameters of your blockchain pretty much indefinitely. Whereas with your hardware wallet you have to keep that plugged into your computer or alternatively use it relatively frequently so as not to get caught out by being too far out of date. Additionally your hardware wallet essentially “freezes” your funds so if you have committed funds to the address on the wallet those funds are doing nothing, no interest, no return, nothing. 

The further idea behind Open Bank is that it should be easily integratable into your dApp. This confers the ability to do things like corporate management of dApp payments and withdrawals. Currently to do this the core team has to have quite a high degree of trust amongst each other to ensure funds are not misappropriated. This is unworkable in an enterprise context where there may be hundreds, thousands or even millions of depositing and withdrawing contract deployments for specific contexts. In short a way is needed to centralize enterprise financial governance in a decentralized context. 

At this point you might say “Why not just use a private blockchain?” And the response to this is cost. The cost to set up, maintain and govern a private blockchain in addition to running the smart contract infrastructure is prohibitive when compared to traditional inhouse Web2 cloud deployments of similar complexity. Added to which Web2 does not integrate the transfer of financial value without a legal context, i.e. api payment communications need to be mapped to a contract somewhere for money to move. Whereas on the blockchain the money can move with the transaction i.e. there is no separate bank transfer it all happens together.
