This is the Open Block Enterprise Initiative for the open bank project.

## What is it?

Open Bank is an exciting new project that enables decentralized applications and DAOs to manage their finances on-chain. It's the best way to store your digital assets without having to resort to contract "ownership" or "multi-sig" models.
The concept is like how your wallet usually contains a couple dollars whilst your wealth is stored far away in a bank somewhere, doing something like earning interest or making automated payments and receipts for you. 

You can now implement decentralized business operations and treasury management on a public blockchain without having to integrate it into your dApp. Open Bank also supports decentralized role management, so different teams and individuals can be given different authorities without the need for code-swapping or redeploying contracts.

For example, if you have one or more dApps and several different teams managing different aspects of your DAO, Open Bank allows you to remove the banking aspects of your dApp operations from your dApp(s) and replace them with decentralized banking that is open to any permissioned team. 

## How does it work?

The diagram above is a simplified representation of an Open Bank architecture. DApp commercial operations have been simplified to "Pay in" and Pay out" whilst business banking operations complexity has been segregated. Each team has operations specific to its area of function enabling more efficient decentralized governance and operation.
